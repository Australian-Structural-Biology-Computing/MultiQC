Description: >
  is an optimized dynamic graph/genome implementation.

The odgi module parses [odgi stats](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_stats1) reports. It is specifically designed to parse the output of

```sh
odgi stats -i input_graph.og -S -s -d -l
```

It is not guaranteed that output created using any other parameter combination can be parsed using this module.
It solely works with report files generated by [odgi stats](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_stats1) in `.tsv` format, which look like the following:

```ts
#length    nodes    edges    paths
8778    168    243    35
#mean_links_length
path    in_node_space    in_nucleotide_space    num_links_considered
all_paths    9.75053    497.321    942
#sum_of_path_node_distances
path    in_node_space    in_nucleotide_space    nodes    nucleotides    num_penalties    num_penalties_different_orientation
all_paths    20.0686     19.5609    977     51365     90    0
```

For the odgi module to discover the [odgi stats](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_stats1) reports, the header must match `#length nodes edges paths`.

A bar graph is generated, which shows the length, number of nodes, edges and paths for each sample.
Additionally, a second bar graph is generated visualizing the `in_node_space` and `in_nucleotide_space` for every sample.

It is possible to add custom content to your MultiQC report including [odgi viz](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_viz1) PNGs.
Ensure that the names of the PNGs match `*_odgi_viz_mqc.png`.
