The odgi module parses odgi stats files and fetches odgi viz PNGs.

It solely works with report files generated by [odgi stats](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_stats1), which look like the following:

```ts
length  nodes   edges   paths
8778    168 243 35
#mean_links_length
path	in_node_space	in_nucleotide_space	num_links_considered
all_paths	9.75053	497.321	942
#sum_of_path_node_distances
path	in_node_space	in_nucleotide_space	nodes	nucleotides	num_penalties	num_penalties_different_orientation
all_paths	20.0686	19.5609	977	51365	90	0
```

A bar graph is generated, which shows the length, number of nodes, edges and paths for each sample.
Additionally, a second bar graph is generated visualizing the ```in_node_space``` and ```in_nucleotide_space``` for every sample. 

Finally, all PNGs generated by [odgi viz](https://pangenome.github.io/odgi/odgi_docs.html#_odgi_viz1) are fetched and presented.
The file names have to match ```*_odgi_viz.png```.
