Name: ccs
URL: https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs
Description: >
	ccs takes multiple subreads of the same SMRTbell molecule and combines them
	using a statistical model to produce one highly accurate consensus sequence,
	also called HiFi read, with base quality values. This tool powers the Circular
	Consensus Sequencing workflow in SMRT Link.

The ccs module parses the report file generated by
[ccs](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/ccs), a PacBio tool to generate
highly accurate single-molecule consensus reads (HiFi Reads).
