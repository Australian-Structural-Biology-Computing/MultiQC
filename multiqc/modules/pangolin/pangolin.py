            This table shows some of the metrics parsed by Pangolin.

            Hover over the column headers to see a description of the contents. Longer help text for certain columns is shown below:

            * Conflict
                * In the pangoLEARN decision tree model, a given sequence gets assigned to the most likely category based on known diversity.
                  If a sequence can fit into more than one category, the conflict score will be greater than 0 and reflect the number of categories the sequence could fit into.
                  If the conflict score is `0`, this means that within the current decision tree there is only one category that the sequence could be assigned to.
            * Ambiguity score
                * This score is a function of the quantity of missing data in a sequence.
                  It represents the proportion of relevant sites in a sequence which were imputed to the reference values.
                  A score of 1 indicates that no sites were imputed, while a score of 0 indicates that more sites were imputed than were not imputed.
                  This score only includes sites which are used by the decision tree to classify a sequence.
            * Scorpio conflict
                * The conflict score is the proportion of defining variants which have the reference allele in the sequence.
                  Ambiguous/other non-ref/alt bases at each of the variant positions contribute only to the denominators of these scores.
            * Note
                * If any conflicts from the decision tree, this field will output the alternative assignments.
                  If the sequence failed QC this field will describe why.
                  If the sequence met the SNP thresholds for scorpio to call a constellation, itâ€™ll describe the exact SNP counts of Alt, Ref and Amb (Alternative, reference and ambiguous) alleles for that call.
